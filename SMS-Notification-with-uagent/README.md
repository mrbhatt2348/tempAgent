# Temperature Monitoring Agent with SMS Notification 🌡️📲

This repository contains a Temperature Monitoring Agent that checks the temperature in a selected location and sends a text message notification to the user if the temperature falls below or rises above the user's desired temperature range. This project was developed for the [Fetch.ai Hackathon](https://lu.ma/fetchai-hackathon) organized by [Fetch.ai](https://fetch.ai/).

## Getting Started 🚀

To use the Temperature Monitoring Agent with SMS notification, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Obtain API Keys 🔑

Before running the agent, you need to obtain the required API keys:

- **OpenWeatherMap API Key:** Get an API key from OpenWeatherMap by signing up at [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api).

- **Sinch SMS API Key:** Sign up for an account on [Sinch](https://www.sinch.com/). After logging in, navigate to the "API" section to create an API token. Ensure you have a Sinch number to send SMS notifications from.

### Step 2: Set Environment Variables 🌐

Create a `.env` file in the project directory and export the obtained API keys as environment variables:

```shell
export OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY="YOUR_OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY"
export SINCH_API_TOKEN="YOUR_SINCH_API_TOKEN"
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies ⚙️

To use the environment variables from the .env file and install the project dependencies, run the following commands:

```shell
source .env
poetry install
```

### Step 4: Run the Agent 🏃

To run the Temperature Monitoring Agent:

```shell 
python main.py
```

- **Enter the city you want to monitor for temperature.**
- **Enter your desired minimum and maximum temperatures.**
- **Now, the agent will periodically check the temperature in the selected location and send you a text message notification if it falls below or rises above your desired temperature range.**

### Example Usage

Here's an example of how to use the Temperature Monitoring Agent:

- **Run the agent using the provided instructions.**
- **Enter the city name you want to monitor (e.g., "London").**
- **Enter your desired minimum temperature (e.g., 15°C).**
- **Enter your desired maximum temperature (e.g., 25°C).**
- **The agent will periodically check the temperature in the selected city.**
- **If the temperature falls below or rises above your desired range, you will receive a text message notification.**

Now you can stay informed about temperature changes in your selected location!
